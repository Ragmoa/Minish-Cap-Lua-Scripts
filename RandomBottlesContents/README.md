# RANDOMIZED BOTTLES CONTENTS

### Usage
- Just load **EITHER** RandomisedBottlesContents.lua or RandomBottlesCotents(Rom's variation).lua in your Bizhawk (You can load both at the same time, but your contents are probably going to be randomized twice. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

### Notes
- Water and Crenel cannot be locked behind items. If you find a seed where they are, please send it to me (*Rylux#7414*) on Discord. (Either the seed printed by the script in the lua console at init or the ups patch of your actual rom seed, because...)

- The randomized contents seed uses your actual item randomizer seed ! (Which means using the same rando seed will also give you the same randomized contents.) The actual seed is used, not the settings, nor the gimmicks seed.

- You can't actually get Nayru's charm with this. Also, because butter is avilable, there will be one more content that you won't be able to get (excluding water and crenel water).

- This being said, you can give a house to any of your two favorite goddesses; There's only two items that can be obtained from charms, and you'll always get them from the goddesses you've given a home to.

- Drinking full milk will give you a randomized content.

- Rom's variation is something *Rom-Steïn* suggested, which is to have your bottles filled with a random content when you first get them

- What's butter? Butter is love, butter is life (especially (s)lightly-salted-one).
