# SWITCHBLADE

### Description

- This script switches your A and B button items every 5 seconds (by default) and when getting damaged.

- You can use the **timerlimit** var to change the number of frames between each switch (Minish Cap runs at 60 fps)

### Notes

- The bomb/arrow count might disappear after a few switches. Opening the inventory will make it appear again.
